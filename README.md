# bog

I am building a MUD (multi-user dungeon) in C++. The original objective of this
project is for me to learn more about sockets, servers, clients, and so on. I
may still add on features over time, but this will be a generally empty world.
So, someone may use this as a base to build upon.

It is built upon my basic server/client program.
