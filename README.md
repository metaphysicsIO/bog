I am building a MUD (multi-user dungeon) in C++. The original objective of this
MUD is for me to learn more about sockets, servers, clients, and so on. I may
still add on features over time, but this will be a generally empty world that
someone could use to build the rest of a MUD with. 

It is built upon my basic server/client program.
